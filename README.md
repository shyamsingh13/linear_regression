# linear_regression
Firstly dataset is uploaded in csv format so you can refer that to get short idea.
IF not then will be providing some Idea about this dataset

# About the car_price dataset
This model is basically data set that contains the information about cars. 
where we have various x-factors in depth so that we predict the model precisely.

# Aim of the model
The main aim to get the price of car and on what factor the price will be dependent.
So the target variable will be the Price of the car

# About the model
So basically we have use the Linear Regression Algorithm to Build the model.

But before that we have analyse the data properly, done the proper EDA and Data Preprocessing of the dataset.
After that we have done the samplig in split of 80:20 Split for training and test the data.
After that we have build Linear regression model where we can predict model. But as we did some
Visualization then we got to know there where some outlier in the dataset which need to be remove
to the better performance in the model. Then we removed the oulier to from the data.
Later on rerun the model & got the Rsquare of 81%.
