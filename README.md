# linear_regression
Firstly dataset is uploaded in csv format so you can refer that to get short idea.
IF not then will be providing some Idea about this dataset

#1 About the car_price dataset

This model is basically data set that contains the information about cars. 
where we have various x-factors in depth so that we predict the model precisely.

Aim of the model--

The main aim to get the price of car and on what factor the price will be dependent.
So the target variable will be the Price of the car

About the model--

So basically we have use the Linear Regression Algorithm to Build the model.

But before that we have analyse the data properly, done the proper EDA and Data Preprocessing of the dataset.
After that we have done the samplig in split of 80:20 Split for training and test the data.
After that we have build Linear regression model where we can predict model. But as we did some
Visualization then we got to know there where some outlier in the dataset which need to be remove
to the better performance in the model. Then we removed the oulier to from the data.
Later on rerun the model & got the Rsquare of 81%.

#2 About the Property_Price dataset

Aim of the model--

The aim to predict the property price.

Here we followed the same procedure as the above as it was also having some null and nan
also some ouliers where so deal with that we followed same step as above and Just to practice.
Here We got the Rsquare as 85%

#3 About the Lungcap_data

problem statement---

To build a prediction model which can predict the lung capacity

About the Model--

As this model is also based on Linear Regression so we 
have followed same thing Analyse the Data, Done EDA and data cleaning.
Along with that sampling the data and building the model.
We got the Rsquare as 84%
